~DESCRIPTION~

This is a collection of soundsets from the old BBC show 'Blackadder'. Recorded, edited, and agonized over by yours truly. If you've never heard of it then don't worry, I'm here to elucidate!


1st soundset:

Titular 'hero' and sometime Elizabethan schmuck Edmund Blackadder is ready to assail you with his razor-sharp wit and sardonic responses. Best suited for greedy rogues and plotting court magicians.


2nd soundset:

Baldrick is the genial dogsbody and steadfast manservant of Edmund Blackadder. Always quick with a questionable plan, he's best suited for panicky thieves and apologetic thugs.


3rd soundset:

Lord Percy, on the other hand, is a fool, jester, and supremely underappreciated chum! Best suited for bards, rogues, and over-enthusiastic gentry.


--A QUICK NOTE--

The sound quality is as good as it's going to get. I've removed countless pops, cracks and snaps, as well as laugh tracks, background noise, coughing, etc., but I'm only one person with limited time on my hands. The audio source has over thirty years on its neck, so there's that.


--CREDITS--

Source: Blackadder (all seasons and specials); Owned by BBC; Voiced by Rowan Atkinson, Tony Robinson, and Tim McInnerny, as Blackadder, Baldrick, and Lord Percy Percy respectively. This is a non-profit fancreation intended for private use only.


--INSTALLATION--

Just pop the audio files into your 'lang/XX_XX/sounds' folder, and the images in your 'portraits' folder in Documents (not the actual game folder).
